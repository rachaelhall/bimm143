This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

## K-means clustering 
```{r}
tmp <- c(rnorm(30,-3), rnorm(30,3))
x <- cbind(x=tmp, y=rev(tmp))
plot(x)
```
```{r}
km <- kmeans(x, centers =2, nstart = 20) 
km
```
## Inspect/print the results
Q. How many points are in each cluster?
Q. What ‘component’ of your result object details
 - cluster size? size??? size 
 - cluster assignment/membership? cluster
 - cluster center? center 
Plot x colored by the kmeans cluster assignment and
 add cluster centers as blue points
```{r}
km$size
```
```{r}
plot(x, col = km$cluster)
points(km$centers, col = "blue", pch = 15, cex=3) 
```

# First we need to calculate point (dis)similarity
# as the Euclidean distance between observations
dist_matrix <- dist(x)
# The hclust() function returns a hierarchical
have to calculate the dist_matrix befire cakkubf hclust 
# clustering model
hc <- hclust(d = dist_matrix)
# the print method is not so useful here
hc
Call:
hclust(d = dist_matrix)
Cluster method : complete
Distance : euclidean

```{r}
d <- dist(x)
hc <- hclust(x)
hc
```
```{r}
hc <- hclust(dist(x))
plot(hc)
```
```{r}
# Draws a dendrogram
plot(hc)
abline(h=6, col="red", lty=2)
abline(h=4, col="blue")
```


```{r}
grp4 <- cutree(hc, h=4 ) 
# Cut into k grps
table(grp4)

```

```{r}
# Step 1. Generate some example data for clustering
x <- rbind(
 matrix(rnorm(100, mean=0, sd = 0.3), ncol = 2), # c1
 matrix(rnorm(100, mean = 1, sd = 0.3), ncol = 2), # c2
 matrix(c(rnorm(50, mean = 1, sd = 0.3), # c3
 rnorm(50, mean = 0, sd = 0.3)), ncol = 2))
colnames(x) <- c("x", "y")
# Step 2. Plot the data without clustering
plot(x)
# Step 3. Generate colors for known clusters
# (just so we can compare to hclust results)
col <- as.factor( rep(c("c1","c2","c3"), each=50) )
plot(x, col=col)
```
Q. Use the `dist()`, `hclust()`, `plot()` and `cutree()`
 functions to return 2 and 3 clusters
Q. How does this compare to your known 'col' groups?
```{r}
hc <- hclust(dist(x))
plot(hc)
abline(h=1.7, col="sky blue")
```
to get cluster memebrship vector use `cutree()` and then use `table()` to tabulate up how many members in each cluster we have 
```{r}
grps <- cutree(hc, k=3)
table(grps)
```
```{r}
plot(x, col=grps)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.
When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 
The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
